There is not a single way of using the scripts: some steps are optional and for a few of them 
there is more than one way that leads to the same place.

First of all, have a look at "Basics_poster.ppt". It is supposed to be an updated overview of 
the main possibilities. Then you can read "Quick_guide.pdf", to see the typical process followed. 
You will see it shows only a few of the possibilities shown in "Basics_poster.ppt". 
"Starting a project.pdf" shows another way of starting a project, showing also a way of working 
with bad elevation data.
